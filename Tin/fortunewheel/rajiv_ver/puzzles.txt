Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment
Donâ€™t dream your life, live your dream
Life begins at the end of your comfort zone
Be the change you wish to see in the world
Life is ten percent what happens to you and ninety percent how you respond to it
Try and fail, but never fail to try
