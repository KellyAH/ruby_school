#What does the following error message tell you?

#ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
# from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
#   from (irb):4
#   from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'


#ANSWER
# in IRB, code on line 12 was executed
#then code on line 4 was executed
#code on line 1 contains a method called "calculate_product" which is expecting 2 arguments to be passed to it.
#it only works properly/executes properly if 2 arguments to be passed to it.
#but only 1 argument was passed.
