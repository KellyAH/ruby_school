#1) Edit the method in exercise #4 so that it does print words on the screen.
#2) What does it return now?

#1)
def scream(words)
  #add exclamation to end of words
  #reassigns new value to words variable
  words = words + "!!!!"

  puts words # will print to screen the words variable value
  #2) returns nil ('cause puts method always returns nil)
end
