#Write a program that includes a method called multiply that takes two arguments and returns the product of the two numbers.

def multiply(num1, num2)
  puts "multiplying #{num1} times #{num2}"
  product = num1 * num2
  return product
end

def test_method_return(method)
  puts method * 1

# #get 2nd number
# puts "please input another number."
# secound_number = gets.chomp.to_i

#multiply(first_number, secound_number)
