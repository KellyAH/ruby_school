Add two strings together that, when concatenated, return your first and last name as your full name in one string.

"<Firstname> <Lastname>"

For example, if your name is John Doe, think about how you can put "John" and "Doe" together to get "John Doe".

=end

fname = "Kelly"
lname = "Hong"


#book didn't say to print it to screen. But I didn't say NOT to do it either! I did it anyways!
puts "my solution:"
puts fname + ' ' + lname


#BOOK ANSWER
puts "book's solution:"
puts "Kelly " + "Hong"
